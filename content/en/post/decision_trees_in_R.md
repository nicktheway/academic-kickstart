## What is a decision tree?
{{< figure src="/img/posts/ds_R/dec_trees/dec_tree_wikipedia.png" alt="A decision tree." caption="Source: Wikipedia">}}

A decision tree is a human-friendly data structure that divides a dataset based on its characteristics and makes it
possible to predict the outcome of a new entry by following the tree's path.

For example, using the tree of the image above, we can predict that a till now undocumented woman probably survived on the Titanic.
